# StacyBootstrap2
This is a resume website I built using Bootstrap3. It's my first Bootstrap3 project, as well as an intro to GIT and github. It is also giving me a real life scenario to try out SCSS (pretty cool btw!), and some new tools (Atom, C9.io, Koala). 

I appreciate any guru feedback including rookie mistakes (did I bloat my CSS ,too many GIT commits, wrong branching etc).
