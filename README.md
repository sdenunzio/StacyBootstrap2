# StacyBootstrap2
This is a resume website I built using Bootstrap3. It's my first Bootstrap3 project, as well as an intro to GIT, github, SCSS and some new tools (Atom, C9.io, Grunt).

I appreciate any guru feedback including rookie mistakes (did I bloat my CSS,  better, easier way of doing css, html5 etc).
